HOW TO ADD CUSTOM CROSSHAIRS

1. Find a crosshair image. Better if it is greyscale.
2. Rename the file as "crosshairXXX.png" without the quotation marks. Replace XXX by the next number.
	Example: the biggest number is currently 200 since the last crosshair image is named "crosshair200.png"
			rename your file as "crosshair201.png" in this case. Keep incrementing by one for future crosshairs.
3. Have fun!
